# Principal Flows
Implements the principal flow algorithm by Professor Yao Zhi Gang ([available here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2013.849199)) using a greedy approach. Let us call it the Greedy Principal Flow.

## Contents

Includes:
- Python Implementation of greedy principal flow and its helper methods.
- Some helper methods written in R.
- Results of the greedy principal flow on various image datasets.
- A comprehensive report, written in latex, detailing the algorithm, some technical background, literature reviews, and an elaboration on the results obtained, as well as potential future work.
- The powerpoint slides I have used to present my work and findings to 2 Professors of Statistics at NUS as part of my presentation component.

## Comments

The code written here is not the cleanest, nor probably the most efficient. I am not sure if I will return to try to make it faster and cleaner. It does however, have semi-detailed docstrings and comments on most methods and files.

In any case, the work here is original and self-contained, and displays 
the work I have put into this endeavor. The work I have done here 
has helped me achieve an A (:D) for my honors thesis. I am very proud of 
the quality of my report and my presentation slides, and still proud 
(albeit less so) of my code. 

To any Statistics juniors taking undertaking ST4199, this can serve as an idea of the work required for each component. All the best for ST4199 :)
